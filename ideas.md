### Save for next turn option 
Save for next turn option such that from my 3 presented cards, I can pick one to reserve for next turn, add one to my hand and ditch the other one.


### send transitions that occurred directly from server to client

a dynamic transition object could be sent every time the gamestate changes and let the client know directly what is goind on, instead of having the client check on its own, what exactly happened.
On the other hand letting the client handle transitions gives client more freedom of how to animate and all.
