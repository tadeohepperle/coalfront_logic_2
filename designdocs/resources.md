Each player has a stready stream of resources they can use each turn. Mostly to build something and to transform into other resources.

Resources other than gold refill every turn. 

Buildings can transform resources.

For example:
2 wood into 2 stone every turn. This only takes effect one turn after they have been built.

Sometimes there is not enough input resources for a player to feed all his buildings.
If this is the case, he has to deactivate them in the endphase. The endphase can be used to deactivate
